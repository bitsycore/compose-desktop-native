# RENDERER_TASKS.md — executable task tracker

The **why/analysis lives in `RENDERER_CONVERGE.md`** (the study file). This file is the
actionable checklist an agent works through over time.

**Goal DECIDED: G1 — upstream-tracking** (cheap upstream tracking with minimal per-bump
reconciliation; JVM is the Windows 100%-fidelity tier; do convergence + guardrails, NOT
Windows pixel-parity). See `RENDERER_CONVERGE.md` §0.5.

## How to use (agent instructions)
- Status marks: `- [ ]` todo · `- [~]` in progress · `- [x]` done · `- [-]` deferred/shelved.
- Finish a task → check it, then append a dated line to **PROGRESS LOG** (bottom) with the
  commit hash and how it was verified.
- Respect **blocked-by**: don't start a task until its blocker is `- [x]`.
- Every *code* task's done-criteria includes a **MAC-VERIFY** pass (both renderers build +
  self-tests + parity on macOS/Linux — see primitives below). Commit only after it's green.
- Keep tasks atomic. If one balloons, split it and note why in the log.
- Do NOT pick up anything under **Deferred / shelved** without an explicit new decision.

## Verification primitives (referenced by task done-criteria)
- **MAC-VERIFY** (macOS or Linux — runs BOTH renderers): `:demo`/`:apidemo`
  `runDebugExecutableMacosArm64` (Skia leg, default) **and** the same with `-Prenderer=sdl3`
  (SDL leg); run `--nav3test --backtest --clicktest --scrolltest --multiwintest` on both and
  gate on PASS/FAIL; run `scripts/parity/parity.py`; a `CDN_PROFILE=1 CDN_FORCERENDER=1`
  `draw`-ms spot-check on LazyColumn/Tabs (fail on >~20% regression vs the pre-change run).
- **WIN-SMOKE** (Windows, pre-ship only): link the mingwX64 target + run `scripts/probe/`.
- **DRIFT-CHECK**: re-run `sync.py` on a clean checkout + diff `src/vendor/`; run the
  manual-vendor provenance check (P0.6).

---

## Phase 0 — Guardrails & harness (do FIRST — makes everything else trustworthy)

- [x] **P0.1** Make `scripts/parity/parity.py` target-aware (`macosArm64` default + a
  `-Prenderer=sdl3` variant), not hardcoded to the mingw exe — so the Mac runs parity for
  BOTH legs. *Done:* one flag switches leg; both produce a ranked report. [CONVERGE §5/§8]
- [x] **P0.2** Add a one-command **MAC-VERIFY runbook** (`scripts/verify-mac.sh` or a
  Makefile/Gradle task) chaining the MAC-VERIFY primitive; non-zero exit on any failure.
  *Done:* `verify-mac` builds both legs + runs self-tests + parity + perf spot-check. [§5]
  *Ran end-to-end GREEN on macOS arm64 (exit 0): drift-check (vendor-clean + provenance) →
  both legs build (demo+apidemo) → 5 probes each (nav3/back/click/scroll/multiwin) →
  parity each → perf seeded (skia LazyColumn 1.75ms/Tabs 2.19ms; sdl3 2.13/6.98). Seeded
  the `macosArm64/{skia,sdl3}` parity keys + the perf baseline. First Mac run also surfaced
  + fixed a real parity harness bug (HiDPI crop-vs-resize — see P0.3 note / log).*
- [x] **P0.3** Font-align the JVM parity leg — load the bundled `NotoSans` in `MainJvm.kt`'s
  `ScreenHost` (stage it into jvm resources; apply via M3 Typography + `LocalTextStyle`).
  *Done (impl + load-verified on Windows):* resource staged, font loads + applies (no
  "not aligned" warning). **Finding:** on the **SDL leg** parity is NOT dominated by typeface
  but by an **accumulating vertical line-metric delta** (SDL3_ttf's NotoSans line height ≠
  Skia's) → text ghosts down the page, so the SDL-leg % barely moves (Buttons 16.5→17.1).
  The ~0% golden-master payoff is **Skia-leg (Mac) only** — pending a Mac run. Confirms the
  §1 "layout-engine delta". [§8]  *blocked-by: P0.1*
- [x] **P0.4** `parity.py`: per-screen golden baselines (`scripts/parity/baselines.json`,
  keyed `target/renderer`) + `--update-baselines` seeder + **exit non-zero** on breach
  (`> baseline + max(3pts, 25%)`) or `NATIVE FAILED`. *Done (Windows):* seeded 57 screens
  for `mingwX64/sdl3`; PASS exit 0, simulated regression exit 1 (`REGRESSION (+16.07)`),
  restore clean; output made ASCII-only (cp1252 console). *Re-seeded post-P0.5 (only
  Pickers 20.02→19.49 and Remember moved — the rest were already settled at frame 6).
  Now also seeded `macosArm64/skia` + `macosArm64/sdl3` (57 each) on the Mac — all three
  keys gate.* [§8]  *blocked-by: P0.1*
- [x] **P0.5** Render-to-quiescence capture on both legs (native `hasInvalidations()`; JVM
  `render(nanos)`/`hasInvalidations`), retiring the fixed `--frames=6`; "disable animations"
  seed for never-settling screens. *Done:* Pickers native-vs-JVM stable across repeated
  runs. **Implementation went further than planned:** quiescence alone didn't stabilise
  Pickers (its TimeInput focus → bring-into-view scroll races real-time frames → final
  offset varied ±10px per run), so the native leg also got **virtual frame time**
  (`useVirtualFrameTime` — clocks step a fixed 16.6ms/frame, mirroring the JVM leg's
  `render(nanos)`). The "disable animations" seed is `disableInfiniteAnimations`: a
  cancelling `InfiniteAnimationPolicy` in each window's Recomposer context (upstream's
  test mechanism), JVM via `ImageComposeScene(coroutineContext=…)`. Result: BOTH legs
  byte-identical across repeated runs, all 57 screens. `--frames=N` is now a quiescence
  CAP (default 300), not a fixed capture point. [§8]
- [x] **P0.6** Manual-vendor **drift tripwire**: `// VENDOR-BASE: <upstream-path>@<ref>`
  headers + a script that flags when a manual vendor's recorded ref lags the current pin.
  *Done:* `scripts/compose-fork/check-vendor-drift.py` reports clean today (exit 0) and a
  simulated stale ref fails (exit 1). *(File-set corrected: `NativeRenderNode.kt` is a port
  invention with no upstream base — annotated the real copy-edits instead: `GraphicsLayer
  OwnerLayer.kt`, `GraphicsLayer.native.kt`, `LayerTransformationMatrix.kt`.)* [§8/§9]
- [x] **P0.7** **Vendor-clean** check target: `sync.py` on a clean checkout + diff
  `src/vendor/`; wire into the runbook. *Done:* passes clean; fails if a hand-edit leaks into
  `src/vendor/`. *(Implemented as `scripts/compose-fork/check-vendor-clean.py`: hash
  src/vendor → run sync.py → re-hash; any changed/stale/missing file or manifest-annotation
  churn fails exit 1 — and the tree is left RESTORED to the pin (sync's normal behaviour).
  Wired into `verify-mac.sh` as step 0 together with the P0.6 tripwire.)* [§8]

## Phase 1 — B2: vendor upstream GraphicsLayer on the Skia leg (the core convergence)

*The maintainability payoff — macOS/Linux run upstream's own layer/draw engine. Re-rated
MODERATE (a source-set migration, not a file-flip). See CONVERGE §4 (B2), §6, §7.*

- [x] **P1.1** **skiko-version alignment check** (DoD gate): confirm `skiko:0.150.1` exposes
  the `RenderNode`/`GraphicsContext` API the compose-core `beta01+dev4324` vendored files
  use; if not, bump `libs.versions.toml` skiko (or the compose ref) in lockstep. *Done:* a
  throwaway skiko-leg compile referencing `org.jetbrains.skiko.node.RenderNode` succeeds on
  the Mac. [§3/§7]  *blocked-by: P0.2*  — **blocks all of P1**
  *Done (Mac): skiko:0.150.1 macosArm64 klib exports `package org.jetbrains.skiko.node`
  with `RenderNode` + `RenderNodeContext` (constructor `RenderNode(ctx)`, `RenderNodeContext
  (measureDrawBounds)`, `.setLightingInfo(...)`, `.close()` — the exact surface beta02's
  SkiaGraphicsContext/SkiaGraphicsLayer use). Verified two ways: klib linkdata inspection +
  a throwaway `skikoRendererMain` file compiling those references via `:ui:compileKotlin
  MacosArm64` (BUILD SUCCESSFUL, then removed). NO skiko/compose-ref bump needed.*
- [x] **P1.2** Relocate the SDL node cluster `nativeMain → sdlRendererMain`:
  `GraphicsLayer.native.kt`, the `createNativeRenderNode` `expect` + SDL actual,
  `DeferredRenderNode`, `SdlDisplayList*`/`SdlRenderNode`. **Keep `GraphicsLayerOwnerLayer`
  SHARED.** *Done:* per-target compile green; MAC-VERIFY green (behaviour unchanged — still
  the port's GraphicsLayer on both legs at this step). [§4/§6]  *blocked-by: P1.1*
  *Done (commit `f8a211cb`): 4 files moved nativeMain→sdlRendererMain (`GraphicsLayer.native
  .kt`, `NativeRenderNode.kt` interface+context, `DeferredRenderNode.kt`, `GraphicsLayer
  Factory.native.kt`). `SdlDisplayList*`/`SdlRenderNode`/`NativeRenderNode.sdl.kt` were
  ALREADY in sdlRendererMain. The `expect fun createNativeRenderNode` dropped (return type no
  longer shared) → the two factories are plain `internal fun`s. `createProjectGraphicsLayer`
  stays a commonMain `expect` with an actual now in each renderer set. Skia leg keeps a
  TRANSIENT copy of the cluster in skikoRendererMain (P1.6 deletes it). Verified: Skia+SDL
  per-target compile, `:ui:compileCommonMainKotlinMetadata` clean, full MAC-VERIFY ALL GREEN
  (10/10 probes, parity PASS both legs, perf within/below baseline).*
- [x] **P1.3** Fork `GraphicsContext` per-leg: replace the ad-hoc anonymous
  `ComposeOwner.graphicsContext` (`createProjectGraphicsLayer()`) with an `expect`/factory
  seam; SDL → the relocated project impl. *Done:* MAC-VERIFY green. [§4]  *blocked-by: P1.2*
  *Done (commit `4a3d8e5c`): `createGraphicsContext()` = `internal expect` in nativeMain,
  actual per renderer set; shared `ProjectGraphicsContext` class (nativeMain). Both legs
  return it this step; skiko actual is TRANSIENT (P1.6 → vendored SkiaGraphicsContext). Full
  MAC-VERIFY ALL GREEN.*
- [ ] **P1.4** Un-refuse + vendor the skiko files into `skikoRendererMain` (flip the `!` in
  `compose-fork.txt`, re-sync): `SkiaGraphicsLayer.skiko.kt`, `SkiaGraphicsContext.skiko.kt`,
  `Matrices.skiko.kt`, `Blur.skiko.kt`. *Done:* `sync.py` brings them in; they compile. [§7]
  *blocked-by: P1.3*
  **⚠ BLOCKER FOUND (2026-07-16, Mac) — the §7 vendoring closure is INCOMPLETE.**
  Upstream `SkiaGraphicsLayer.skiko.kt` records into skiko `RenderNode` and hands its draw
  block an upstream **`SkiaBackedCanvas`** (`renderNode.beginRecording().asComposeCanvas()
  as SkiaBackedCanvas`, lines 343/347 @ beta02). `SkiaBackedCanvas` is REFUSED (manifest
  line 518) because the port has its OWN `SkiaCanvas` (raw `org.jetbrains.skia.Canvas`
  wrapper implementing `NativeTextCanvas`/`NativePainterCanvas`/`NativeShadowCanvas`) — the
  entire Skia leaf-draw / text (`SkiaTextRenderer`) / painter / shadow pipeline is coded
  against `SkiaCanvas`, NOT `SkiaBackedCanvas`. So "flip 4 `!`s and it compiles" is FALSE;
  the real closure either (a) also adopts upstream's `SkiaBackedCanvas` + Paint/Shader/text
  stack = the **shelved B6**, or (b) manual-vendors `SkiaGraphicsLayer` with an edit bridging
  `beginRecording()`'s skia Canvas into the port `SkiaCanvas` — which makes it a NON-verbatim
  manual vendor, eroding B2's whole sync-tax payoff (P1.8). The port uses skiko `RenderNode`
  NOWHERE today (grep-confirmed). **Decision required before P1.4 proceeds — see log + the
  three options below.** [§7]  *blocked-by: P1.3 (done); now blocked on a scope decision*
  **DECISION (2026-07-16, user): Option B — full upstream Skia canvas (=B6).** P1.4/P1.5/P1.6
  are SUBSUMED by the new **Phase 1B (B6)** below — the skiko leg switches to upstream's
  SkiaBackedCanvas so `SkiaGraphicsLayer` vendors cleanly. Deeper scoping (from a full draw-
  dispatch map, 2026-07-16) below.
- [x] **P1.5 — DONE via B6.2** (matrix): skiko DRAW uses upstream `SkiaGraphicsLayer`'s own
  skiko-RenderNode transform; the shared `prepareLayerTransformationMatrix` stays for
  `GraphicsLayerOwnerLayer` HIT-TEST on both legs (it's shared, can't drop from skiko) and
  provably agrees (clicktest/scrolltest/backtest PASS on transformed layers). The literal
  "drop the copy" doesn't apply — it's shared, not skiko-only.
- [x] **P1.6 — DONE via B6.2** (commit `2210d1fa`): upstream `actual class GraphicsLayer(skiko
  .RenderNode)` provided by the un-refused `SkiaGraphicsLayer.skiko.kt`; the skiko `NativeRender
  Node` cluster (incl. `NativeRenderNode.skia.kt`) deleted. MAC-VERIFY Skia leg green, parity
  holds golden-master, PERF IMPROVED (draw 1.75ms→0.2ms).
- [x] **P1.7 — DONE via B6.2** (the actual-API-parity invariant): `:ui:compileCommonMain
  KotlinMetadata` is the enforcement — `GraphicsLayerOwnerLayer` (shared) compiles against
  BOTH `GraphicsLayer` actuals (upstream skiko + port SDL) only if both satisfy the commonMain
  `expect class GraphicsLayer` API; it's in the MAC-VERIFY runbook (verify-mac step) and in
  every per-leg compile. A skew fails the metadata compile. *(Kept as an ongoing invariant,
  not a one-off check.)*
- [x] **P1.8** (measure — the G1 justification) Quantify the **sync-tax**. *Done (2026-07-17,
  grounded in the actual B2 diff + the O.2 beta01→beta02 bump):* B2 cut the hand-maintained
  upstream-tracking surface on the skiko rendering path **~8.5×**. BEFORE: ~1240 lines of
  hand-rolled skiko rendering (`SkiaCanvas` 508, `GraphicsLayer.native` 321, the port node
  cluster `DeferredRenderNode`/`NativeRenderNode`/`.skia` ~344, `SkiaImageBitmap` ~65) — every
  upstream Canvas/GraphicsLayer semantic change had to be hand-reconciled. AFTER: 1006 lines
  (`SkiaGraphicsLayer` 515 + `SkiaGraphicsContext` 78 + `Blur` 40 + `SkiaBackedPaint` 174 +
  `SkiaShader` 175 + `ImageBitmap` 24) auto-sync VERBATIM on a ref bump (zero reconciliation);
  the hand-reconciled surface shrinks to ~145 lines of edits across 2 drift-tracked manual
  vendors (`SkiaBackedCanvas` Native* tail, `SkiaImageAsset` 2 inlined funcs), which
  `check-vendor-drift.py` (P0.6) flags precisely on a bump. Bonus: fidelity is now INHERITED
  from upstream's engine (real display-list caching, correct clip/shadow) instead of
  hand-approximated — the O.2 bump proved the verbatim re-sync path works end-to-end. [§0.5]

## Phase 1B — B6: full upstream Skia canvas (the enabler for B2, DECIDED 2026-07-16)

*Why here: P1.4 proved the skiko leg can't vendor upstream `SkiaGraphicsLayer` while it draws
through the port `SkiaCanvas`. User chose Option B — adopt upstream's Skia canvas so the layer
vendors cleanly. A full draw-dispatch map (2026-07-16) established the real surface below.*

**Scoping facts (from the dispatch map).** The composition draws text/images/shadows by casting
the frame `Canvas` to project contracts — `NativeTextCanvas` (`SdlParagraph.paint` →
`drawNativeText`), `NativePainterCanvas` (`ResourcePainter.onDraw`), `NativeShadowCanvas`
(`DeferredRenderNode.draw`) — plus a `NativeFinishableCanvas` no-op. `NativeShapeClipCanvas` is
SDL-only (Skia already falls back to `clipPath`, needs no bridge). Upstream `SkiaBackedCanvas`
implements NONE of these; every cast is a defensive `as?` that silently no-ops → text/images/
shadows go DARK on `SkiaBackedCanvas` unless bridged. Measurement (`currentTextMeasurer`) does
NOT go through the canvas and is unaffected — but it and drawing share ONE `SkiaTextRenderer`
instance (must stay coupled). Real gradients are a fidelity WIN: the port `SkiaCanvas` uses
solid-color brush fallback; `SkiaBackedCanvas`+`SkiaShader` draw true gradients (Brushes screen).

- [x] **B6.1** Adopt upstream Skia GRAPHICS actuals on the skiko leg. Split
  `CanvasPaintActuals.native.kt` (which defines the port `Paint`/`Shader`/all gradient
  shaders/`ActualImageBitmap`/`createImageBitmap`/`ActualCanvas`/`NativeCanvas`/`NativePaint`)
  `nativeMain → sdlRendererMain`; un-refuse (flip `!` + re-sync) `SkiaBackedCanvas.skiko.kt`,
  `SkiaBackedPaint.skiko.kt`, `SkiaShader.skiko.kt`, `SkiaImageAsset.skiko.kt`,
  `ImageBitmap.skiko.kt` into `skikoRendererMain` (they provide the SAME actuals, skia-typed;
  disjoint targets → no clash). Route the frame + offscreen draw canvas (SkiaRenderBackend
  `drawRoot`, SkiaOffscreen `createCanvas`) through `SkiaBackedCanvas`. **Bridge the 3 live
  contracts**: keep the port `SkiaTextRenderer`/`SkiaImageCache`/shadow code, expose them via a
  GLOBAL skiko draw-renderer (like the existing `offscreenRenderer`/`currentTextMeasurer`
  globals) and MANUAL-VENDOR `SkiaBackedCanvas.skiko.kt` to also implement `NativeTextCanvas`/
  `NativePainterCanvas`/`NativeShadowCanvas`/`NativeFinishableCanvas`, delegating via its own
  `.skiaCanvas`. (VENDOR-BASE header + drift tripwire required — it becomes a manual vendor.)
  *Done:* MAC-VERIFY green; Brushes parity IMPROVES (real gradients); text/icons/shadows/images
  unchanged. *blocked-by: P1.3 (done)*
  *DONE (commit `7f5773fc`). Findings: (1) the port ALREADY had real gradient shaders (the
  "solid-color fallback" header comment was stale) → Brushes unchanged, not improved. (2)
  `SkiaImageAsset` also needed manual-vendoring — its `toBitmap`/`putBytesInto` expect+actual
  collapse into one native source set here (flattened, bodies inlined). (3) `skiaLeafDrawer`
  MUST be re-pointed per-frame in drawRoot (+ cleared on destroy), not set once in the ctor —
  a ctor global dangled at a CLOSED window's destroyed renderer → multiwintest crash. Full
  MAC-VERIFY ALL GREEN both legs; 56/57 parity byte-identical (Images fluctuates in noise).*
- [x] **B6.2** Now the canvas is `SkiaBackedCanvas`: un-refuse + vendor `SkiaGraphicsLayer.skiko
  .kt` + `SkiaGraphicsContext.skiko.kt` + `Blur.skiko.kt`; point the skiko `createGraphicsContext`
  actual (P1.3 seam) at `SkiaGraphicsContext`; provide upstream `actual class GraphicsLayer
  (skiko.RenderNode)`; DELETE the transient skiko port cluster (GraphicsLayer.native.kt,
  NativeRenderNode.kt, DeferredRenderNode.kt, NativeRenderNode.skia.kt, GraphicsLayerFactory,
  GraphicsContextFactory.skia's ProjectGraphicsContext use). Reverse the
  `prepareLayerTransformationMatrix` rename → upstream `Matrices.skiko` (this is P1.5). Do NOT
  vendor `ChildLayerDependenciesTracker` (P2.2) — reconcile if `SkiaGraphicsLayer` hard-needs it.
  *Done:* MAC-VERIFY Skia leg — parity holds ~golden-master, blur/RenderEffect improve (P2.3).
  This IS P1.6 + P1.7 (the actual-API-parity invariant). *blocked-by: B6.1*
  *DONE (commit `2210d1fa`). ChildLayerDependenciesTracker was ALREADY vendored (commonMain)
  → SkiaGraphicsLayer vendors VERBATIM, no manual edit (supersedes P2.2's "don't vendor
  tracker" for the skiko leg — upstream's GraphicsLayer inherently uses it). Also had to move
  `Blur.native.kt` nativeMain→sdl (same split as the paint actuals) and relocate
  `ProjectGraphicsContext` + `createProjectGraphicsLayer` nativeMain→sdl (drop the commonMain
  expect — SDL-only now). GraphicsLayerOwnerLayer stays SHARED, compiles against both
  actuals (P1.7 invariant holds via the metadata compile). Hit-test agrees with the new
  skiko-RenderNode draw (clicktest/scrolltest/backtest PASS). Layer screens byte-stable
  (transparent swap). PERF WIN: skia draw 1.75ms→0.2ms (skiko RenderNode display-list cache).
  P1.5 rename-reversal N/A: prepareLayerTransformationMatrix stays shared (GraphicsLayerOwnerLayer
  hit-test needs it on both legs); skiko DRAW uses upstream's matrix internally and agrees.*
- [-] **B6.3 — DECIDED: SKIP (2026-07-17, user).** Full upstream TEXT on the skiko leg is NOT
  worth it under G1. A full subsystem map (Explore agent, 2026-07-17) showed it is NOT a canvas-
  style swap but a **font-subsystem replacement with two coexisting identity models**:
  • The port uses a name→bytes `IconFont` registry + a no-op `FontFamilyResolver` + renderer-
    owned typeface resolution; upstream `SkiaParagraph` needs `PlatformFont`/`LoadedFont` in a
    real `FontCache`/`FontCollection` resolved by `FontFamilyResolverImpl(SkiaFontLoader)`.
  • The shared ICON path (`IconText`/`TextDrawNode`/`currentTextMeasurer`/`drawNativeText`,
    foundation commonMain) is used on BOTH legs → the port text model can't be removed, it must
    COEXIST with upstream on the skiko leg.
  • Cost: re-vendor ~13 dropped skiko files + split ~10 shared actuals per-renderer (the
    `Paragraph` interface itself is expect/actual) + a `data.kres`→`FontCache` bridge; NO green
    intermediate (atomic, multi-session, long font-debug tail); DISCARDS P3.1.
  • ROI: LOW. On the skiko leg text MEASUREMENT already uses skiko `Font` metrics
    (`currentTextMeasurer`→`SkiaTextRenderer`) — that's how P3.1 hit ~2%. `SkiaParagraph` would
    mainly add ICU line-breaking/bidi/complex-shaping + exact wrapping, a modest gain for the
    demo's Latin text, and under G1 the JVM leg is the fidelity tier anyway.
  Left as the port's permanent text architecture. Revisit only if complex-script/bidi fidelity
  on the NATIVE skiko leg becomes a hard requirement.

**B2 CONVERGENCE COMPLETE (2026-07-17):** the skiko leg runs upstream's own Canvas (B6.1) +
GraphicsLayer/GraphicsContext (B6.2) verbatim. Text stays the port's engine (B6.3 skipped).

## Phase 2 — B5: engine-convergence deltas

- [ ] **P2.1** Audit CDN-common vs upstream `skikoMain`; list every hand-rolled divergence
  and vendor the deltas (or record a named constraint). *Done:* a checked-off delta list. [§7]
- [ ] **P2.2** Lifetime model: **keep shared GC/release-queue on BOTH legs; do NOT vendor
  `ChildLayerDependenciesTracker`.** Add a **soak test** (navigate all screens ×N, assert an
  RSS ceiling) to cover the leak class. *Done:* soak passes on both legs. [§7/§8]
- [ ] **P2.3** Restore layer **outsets / blur-bounds expansion** via `Blur.skiko` on the Skia
  leg (fixes clipped blur in parity). *Done:* a blur/RenderEffect screen's Skia parity
  improves. [§7]  *blocked-by: P1.6*

## Phase 3 — B3: SDL fidelity (CAPPED under G1 — only parity-ranked user-visible wins)

- [~] **P3.1** From the parity ranking, list the worst *user-visible* SDL gaps (gamma
  gradients / AA / blur / complex-script text). Do ONLY the ones that rank as real wins, each
  gated by a parity improvement. **Stop when the ranking flattens** — JVM is the fidelity
  tier for the rest. [§0.5.3, §4 (B3)]
  **RESOLVED: the whole "font-drift baseline" was line-metric drift.** Fixing the text
  metrics (see log: lineHeight modes + JVM-matched font cells) collapsed the ranking from
  a ~17% median to **~2%** — Tabs 33.3→1.8, GridsExtra 28.5→1.3, Shadows 24.6→1.5,
  Brushes 22.3→2.2, Carousel 23.1→1.9, Animation 24.5→3.0. The previously-suspected
  "gradient ramp" and "shadow falloff" gaps were ALSO mostly drift — both now sit in the
  ~2% noise floor. **Post-fix ranking (what's actually left):**
  1. Pickers 19.5 — TimeInput focus auto-scroll positioning differs between legs
     (bring-into-view final offset); interaction-layout, not rendering.
  2. Images 16.6 — NOT image rendering: the JVM leg soft-WRAPS the descriptions one word
     earlier (glyph advances run slightly wider) → +1 line → content below shifts. A
     per-glyph advance-width parity item (kerning/advance rounding), its own investigation.
  3. AnnotatedString 8.1 — metric-span line heights (styled cells vs upstream span boxes).
  4. Search 5.3 — unread; then Canvas 4.3 / CustomLayout 4.1 and the ~2% tail — JVM is
     the fidelity tier for the rest (§0.5.3).
  *(Text 9.2 was the h=1.0 lineHeight boundary — fixed, now 3.1.)*

## Ongoing — vendoring cadence

- [x] **O.1** Pin `COMPOSE_CORE_REF` to a durable **tag** (not the `+dev` commit that upstream
  may GC). *Done:* a fresh clone can `sync.py` from the pinned ref. *(Pin switched to tag
  `v1.12.0-beta01+dev4324` — verified to dereference to the exact previous hash `1be9d64…`
  and to exist on upstream's remote (`ls-remote`), so clone/fetch-by-name always works;
  the 3 `VENDOR-BASE` headers re-spelled to the tag so P0.6's ref-compare stays green.)* [§9]
- [~] **O.2** Write + follow the **ref-bump runbook**: bump → `sync.py` → build → DRIFT-CHECK
  → MAC-VERIFY + WIN-SMOKE. Run it on each upstream bump. [§9] *(First real bump executed:
  beta01+dev4324 → **v1.12.0-beta02**, see log. Windows legs green end-to-end; the Mac legs
  of MAC-VERIFY still pend P0.2's first Mac run.)*

## Deferred / shelved (NOT active — do not pick up without a new decision)

- [-] **Track A** — real Skia on Windows K/N. Shelved under G1 (likely infeasible + breaks
  no-DLL; maintenance payoff doesn't justify the spike). [§0.5.4, §3]
- [-] **B1** — SDL-only node-dedup base (`AbstractNativeRenderNode` in `sdlRendererMain`).
  Deferred; cleanup on the newly-default hot path, no G1 payoff yet. [§4 (B1)]
- [-] **Module split** — extract `:ui-graphics` / `:ui-text` from `:ui`. Deferred until a
  consumer needs the publishing granularity (relocation churn + bridge-substitution fan-out,
  no user benefit yet). [§6]
- [-] **B6** — make Skia-leg text truly upstream (skiko `SkiaParagraph` + `SkiaBackedCanvas`).
  Optional; only if the text-metrics parity delta proves worth it. [§1, §7]

- 2026-07-16 · **P1.4 BLOCKER (investigation, no code)** · un-refusing upstream
  `SkiaGraphicsLayer.skiko.kt` does NOT compile in isolation: it casts its recording canvas
  to `SkiaBackedCanvas` (upstream's Canvas actual), which the port refuses in favour of its
  own `SkiaCanvas`. The whole Skia draw/text pipeline binds `SkiaCanvas`. The §4/§7 "vendor
  4 files verbatim" closure missed this. Three ways forward (a decision the maintainer owns,
  since it changes B2's cost/benefit under G1):
    **Option C (recommended) — wrap skiko RenderNode behind the port's `NativeRenderNode`.**
      Back `NativeRenderNode.skia.kt` with skiko `RenderNode` (record the port draw block
      into `beginRecording()`'s canvas wrapped as the port `SkiaCanvas`; replay via
      `RenderNode.drawInto`). KEEP the port `GraphicsLayer` + `SkiaCanvas`. Gets the real
      display-list node (record-once caching + skiko clip/shadow fidelity — the engine win)
      with NO B6 entanglement and NO SkiaBackedCanvas. The port's ORIGINAL "Phase 2a"; drops
      the "vendor upstream GraphicsLayer verbatim" sub-goal (and its P1.8 sync-tax claim).
    **Option A — manual-vendor `SkiaGraphicsLayer` with a SkiaCanvas bridge edit.**
      Non-verbatim → partial sync-tax; still needs textRenderer threading; keeps upstream's
      `ChildLayerDependenciesTracker` (P2.2 says DON'T vendor it).
    **Option B — full upstream Skia canvas adoption** (un-refuse `SkiaBackedCanvas` + Paint +
      Shader + ImageAsset + upstream text): this IS the shelved B6. Largest; abandons the
      port's SkiaCanvas/SkiaTextRenderer investment.
- 2026-07-16 · **B6 DECISION + plan (user chose Option B)** · no code yet · mapped the full
  skiko draw-dispatch (Explore agent): the frame canvas carries 4 project contracts
  (`NativeTextCanvas`/`NativePainterCanvas`/`NativeShadowCanvas`/`NativeFinishableCanvas`);
  `NativeShapeClipCanvas` is SDL-only (Skia falls back to clipPath). Upstream `SkiaBackedCanvas`
  implements none → text/images/shadows would go dark unless bridged. Concluded clean "full
  upstream canvas" cascades into text/painter/shadow (upstream `SkiaParagraph` is a whole
  separate subsystem that discards P3.1). Staged B6 as **B6.1** (graphics actuals: split
  `CanvasPaintActuals` per-renderer, un-refuse SkiaBackedCanvas/Paint/Shader/ImageAsset/
  ImageBitmap, route frame+offscreen through SkiaBackedCanvas, bridge the 3 live contracts via a
  global draw-renderer + a MANUAL-VENDOR of SkiaBackedCanvas) → **B6.2** (= P1.4/1.5/1.6/1.7: vendor
  SkiaGraphicsLayer/Context/Blur now the canvas is upstream, delete the transient skiko port
  cluster) → **B6.3** (optional upstream text, discards P3.1 on skiko — defer). Plan written to
